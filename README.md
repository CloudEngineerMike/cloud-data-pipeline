## 🔄 How It Works  

Blob Questor runs on a **set schedule** to pull data from Azure and transport it securely to AWS:  

1️⃣ **Azure Function App** runs **hourly**, executing a PowerShell script that queries Azure's resources and saves the results in a Blob file.  
2️⃣ **CloudWatch Events** triggers an AWS Lambda function **twice a day** to initiate data transfer.  
3️⃣ **Lambda** authenticates with **Secrets Manager** to retrieve the Azure Storage Account Key.  
4️⃣ Using the retrieved key, **Lambda gains access** to the Azure Blob storage container.  
5️⃣ **Lambda temporarily stores** the Blob file in **/tmp**, then **uploads it to S3**—securing it for further processing.  

💡 **Why It’s Awesome**  
✔ **Fully Automated** – No manual intervention needed  
✔ **Multi-Cloud Ready** – Works across Azure & AWS  
✔ **Secure & Scalable** – Uses encrypted credentials and cloud-native services
